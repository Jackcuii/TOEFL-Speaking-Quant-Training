# TOEFL-Speaking-Quant-Training
A user friendly tool to train your TOEFL speaking skill precisely.

I do not have experience in develop a GUI, so I try the complete prompt engineering to construct the tool.  
I use the **nicegui** package to develop the GUI.  
Actually, I have no idea to **nicegui** at all in the beginning, and I use about 2h 40min to finish the demo v0.1 (about 200 lines Python codes).  
Not bad, ya? (Although for some talents, this is much longer than their learning + coding time.)

I only read the **nicegui** docs for 2 times.   
- to tell Copilot the old API **ui.open** is deserted.
- to tell Copilot the API detail of setting property for the image.

I put the whole dialog with Copilot in `/dialog`.

This practice shows that LLM reforms our frontend GUI development. But there is still a long way to go in code prompt-engineering. (both for me and GPT)
